        The Little Mermaid becomes melancholy and asks her grandmother if humans can live forever. The grandmother explains
             that humans have a much shorter lifespan than a mermaid's 300 years, but that when mermaids die, they turn to sea foam
              and cease to exist, while humans have an eternal soul that lives on in heaven. The Little Mermaid, longing for the prince
               and an eternal soul, visits the Sea Witch in a dangerous part of the ocean. The witch willingly helps her by selling her 
               a potion that gives her legs in exchange for her tongue and beautiful voice, and she warns her that once she becomes a human,
                she will never be able to return to the sea. Consuming the potion will make her feel as if a sword is being passed 
                through her body, yet when she recovers, she will have two human legs and will be able to dance like no human has 
                ever danced before. However, she will constantly feel as if she is walking on sharp knives. In addition, she will 
                obtain a soul only if she wins the love of the prince and marries him, for then a part of his soul will flow into her.
                <br>
                 Otherwise, at dawn on the first day after he marries someone else, the Little Mermaid will die with a broken heart
                  and dissolve into sea foam upon the waves.
        After she agrees to the arrangement, the Little Mermaid swims to the surface near the prince's palace and drinks the potion. 
            She is found by the prince, who is mesmerized by her beauty and grace, even though she is considered dumb and mute by
             everyone in the kingdom. Most of all, he likes to see her dance, and she dances for him despite suffering excruciating
              pain with every step. Soon, the Little Mermaid becomes the prince's favorite companion and accompanies him on many of
               his outings. When the prince's parents encourage their son to marry the neighboring princess in an arranged marriage,
                the prince tells the Little Mermaid he will not because he does not love the princess. He goes on to say he can only 
                love the young woman from the temple, who he believes rescued him. It turns out that the princess from the neighboring 
                kingdom is the temple girl. The prince declares his love for her, and the royal wedding is announced at once.
                <br>
        The prince and princess celebrate their new marriage on a wedding ship, and the Little Mermaid's heart breaks. She thinks
             of all that she has sacrificed and of all the pain she has endured for the prince. She despairs, thinking of the death
              that awaits her, but before dawn, her sisters rise out of the water and bring her a knife that the Sea Witch has given 
              them in exchange for their long, beautiful hair. If the Little Mermaid kills the prince and lets his blood drip on her feet, 
              she will become a mermaid once more, all of her suffering will end, and she will live out her full life in the ocean with her family.</p>
