            The Little Mermaid dwells in an underwater kingdom with her widowed father (the sea king or Mer-King), 
            her dowager grandmother, and her five older sisters, each of whom had been born one year apart. When a mermaid 
            turns fifteen, she is permitted to swim to the surface for the first time to glimpse the world above, and when 
            the sisters become old enough, each of them visits the upper world one at a time every year. As each returns, 
            the Little Mermaid listens longingly to their various descriptions of the world inhabited by human beings.

            <br> 
            When the Little Mermaid's turn comes, she rises up to the surface, watches a birthday celebration being held 
            on a ship in honor of a handsome prince, and falls in love with him from a safe distance. A violent storm hits, 
            sinking the boat, and the Little Mermaid saves the prince from drowning. She delivers him unconscious to the shore 
            near a temple. Here, she waits until a young woman from the temple and her ladies in waiting find him. To her dismay, 
            the prince never sees the Little Mermaid or even realizes that it was she who had originally saved his life.
